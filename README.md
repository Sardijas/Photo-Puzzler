# Photo-Puzzler

This was my 15-112 term project for the Fall Semester 2021.
It uses OpenCV and Numpy to convert photo images to playable nonogram games.

It has four modes: easy, medium, and hard, as well as an 'Artist' mode that 
  uses paintings from the SMK museum's API. Its 'shuffle' feature uses the 
  colormind API.

Code in main.py and menu.py was written by me unless noted otherwise in comments. 
Most of the code in CMU graphics was not written by me; I just added a 
  few lines (noted by comments) to make the game work.
